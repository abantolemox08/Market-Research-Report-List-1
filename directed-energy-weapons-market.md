<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Directed Energy Weapons Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lethal Weapons</li><li>Non-Lethal Weapons</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Directed Energy Weapons (DEWs) are categorized into lethal and non-lethal segments. Lethal DEWs are designed to cause destruction or incapacitate targets, using concentrated energy forms like lasers or high-power microwaves. In contrast, non-lethal DEWs aim to disable or deter opponents without permanent damage, often employing less intense energy such as dazzling lasers or electromagnetic pulses. Both markets are driven by military and defense applications, but non-lethal variants are increasingly used in law enforcement and crowd control situations.</p></p>
