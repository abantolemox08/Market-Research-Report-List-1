<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Humidification System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water to Gas</li><li>Gas to Gas</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas humidification systems are categorized into two main types: water-to-gas and gas-to-gas humidification. Water-to-gas systems inject moisture directly from water sources into gas streams, enhancing the gas quality for applications like combustion and process heating. In contrast, gas-to-gas humidification involves transferring humidity from a humid gas to a drier gas, often used to maintain specific moisture levels in industrial processes. Both methods aim to optimize gas performance, improve efficiency, and meet regulatory or operational requirements.</p></p>
