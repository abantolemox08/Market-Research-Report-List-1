<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Remote Keyless Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Keyless Entry Systems</li><li>Active Keyless Entry Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Remote Keyless Systems are categorized into two main types: Passive Keyless Entry Systems (PKES) and Active Keyless Entry Systems (AKES). PKES allows users to unlock and start vehicles without physically pressing buttons, using proximity sensors that detect key fobs nearby. In contrast, AKES requires users to actively press buttons on their key fob to unlock or start the vehicle. Both systems enhance convenience and security, with PKES often offering a more seamless experience while AKES provides a more traditional approach.</p></p>
